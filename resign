Dear All,
 

Change is the only thing CONSTANT in this world, and you must embrace it. Today is one of those days where change is happening in my life, as many of you know today is my last day in LTI.

To embrace this change, I have with me very wonderful and fulfilling memories of 7.6 years !!

 

Working in LTI has been an incredible learning adventure and I am thankful to everyone I met in this journey as each one of you are extraordinary in your own special way.

 

I would like to thank my leaders Vikas for their constant support and giving me various opportunities.

 


I would also like to extend my gratitude to every person with whom I have worked directly/indirectly.

 

I must say to all of you to stay in touch, I am just a message away.

 

Stay Safe !! Take Care !! All the best for your future endeavours !!
